Project: CNED MEGAMART - An E-commerce website

This project aims to test my ability to create a responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

The purpose of the homepage is to provide a seamless user experience. It has clear navigation tabs and a search bar with products grouped according to deals, brands, etc. Also, there is an option for users to subscribe to email newsletters. 

The target audience is anyone with access to the internet. Because of this, I ensured the design was responsive since users would be visiting the site using devices with different screen sizes.

To ensure that users find it easy to use, I ensured that the homepage is easy to navigate. Each tab on the navigation bar is linked to the corresponding section to help users quickly find what they are looking for. There is also a search bar to help users find a specific item on the website using any keyword.

The choice of blue and white colours ensures a perfect blend and a visually appealing design. It also helped in making the texts readable.

I used blue call-to-action buttons on a white background and white buttons on a blue background to ensure they are clear and easily attract users' attention.
